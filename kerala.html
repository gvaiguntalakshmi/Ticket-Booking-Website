          Kerala (English: /ˈkɛrələ/ KERR-ə-lə; Malayalam: [ke:ɾɐɭɐm] (About
          this soundlisten)) is a state on the Malabar Coast of India.[13] It
          was formed on 1 November 1956, following the passage of the States
          Reorganisation Act, by combining Malayalam-speaking regions of the
          erstwhile regions of Cochin, Malabar, South Canara, and
          Travancore.[14][15] Spread over 38,863 km2 (15,005 sq mi), Kerala is
          the twenty-first largest Indian state by area. It is bordered by
          Karnataka to the north and northeast, Tamil Nadu to the east and
          south, and the Lakshadweep Sea[16] to the west. With 33 million
          inhabitants as per the 2011 census, Kerala is the thirteenth-largest
          Indian state by population. It is divided into 14 districts with the
          capital being Thiruvananthapuram. Malayalam is the most widely spoken
          language and is also the official language of the state
        </p>

          The Chera Dynasty was the first prominent kingdom based in Kerala. The
          Ay kingdom in the deep south and the Ezhimala kingdom in the north
          formed the other kingdoms in the early years of the Common Era (CE).
          The region had been a prominent spice exporter since 3000 BCE. The
          region's prominence in trade was noted in the works of Pliny as well
          as the Periplus around 100 CE. In the 15th century, the spice trade
          attracted Portuguese traders to Kerala, and paved the way for European
          colonisation of India. At the time of Indian independence movement in
          the early 20th century, there were two major princely states in
          Kerala: Travancore and Cochin. They united to form the state of
          Thiru-Kochi in 1949. The Malabar region, in the northern part of
          Kerala, had been a part of the Madras province of British India, which
          later became a part of the Madras State post-independence. After the
          States Reorganisation Act, 1956, the modern-day state of Kerala was
          formed by merging the Malabar district of Madras State (excluding
          Gudalur taluk of Nilgiris district, Lakshadweep Islands, Topslip, the
          Attappadi Forest east of Anakatti), the taluk of Kasaragod (now
          Kasaragod District) in South Canara (Tulunad), and the erstwhile state
          of Thiru-Kochi (excluding four southern taluks of Kanyakumari
          district, and Shenkottai taluks)
