          Tamil Nadu (/ˌtæmɪl ˈnɑːduː/; Tamil: [ˈtamiɻ ˈnaːɽɯ] (About this
          soundlisten)) is a state in southern India. Its capital and largest
          city is Chennai. Lying in the southern-most part of the Indian
          subcontinent, Tamil Nadu is bordered by the Indian union territory of
          Puducherry and the states of Kerala, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh, as
          well as an international maritime border with Sri Lanka. The state is
          bounded by the Western Ghats in the west, the Eastern Ghats in the
          north, the Bay of Bengal in the east, the Gulf of Mannar and Palk
          Strait to the south-east, and the Indian Ocean in the south. The
          official language is Tamil, one of the longest-surviving classical
          languages in the world. The region was ruled by several regimes,
          including the "three crowned rulers" – Chera, Chola and Pandyan
          states, which shape the region's cuisine, culture, and architecture.
          After the fall of the Kingdom of Mysore, the British Colonial rule
          during the modern period led to the emergence of Chennai, then known
          as Madras, as a metropolitan city. Modern-day Tamil Nadu was formed in
          1956 after the reorganisation of states on linguistic lines. The state
          is home to a number of historic buildings, multi-religious pilgrimage
          sites, hill stations and three World Heritage Sites.[8][9][10] The
          economy of Tamil Nadu is the second-largest in India, with a gross
          state domestic product (GSDP) of ₹21.6 trillion (US$290 billion) and
          has the country's 11th-highest GSDP per capita of ₹229,000
          (US$3,000).[3] It ranks 11th among all Indian states in human
          development index.[6] Tamil Nadu is the most urbanised state in India,
          and one of the most industrialised states; the manufacturing sector
          accounts for more than one-third of the state's GDP.[11] Tamil Nadu is
          the tenth largest Indian state by area and the sixth largest by
          population.
