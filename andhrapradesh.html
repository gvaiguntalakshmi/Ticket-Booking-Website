        Early inhabitants were known as the Andhras, tracing their history to
        the Vedic period when they were mentioned in the 8th century BCE
        Rigvedic text Aitareya Brahmana. According to the Aitareya Brahmana, the
        Andhras left North India from the banks of river Yamuna and migrated to
        South India.[24][25] The Assaka Mahajanapada (700–300 BCE) was an
        ancient kingdom located between the Godavari and Krishna rivers in
        southeastern India accounts that people in the region are descended from
        the Viswamitra are found in the Ramayana, the Mahabharata and the
        Puranas.[26][clarification needed] The region also derives its name from
        Satavahanas who are also known as Andhras, the earliest kings of Andhra
        Pradesh and India.[27] Early peoples supported local art culture by
        building temples and sculptures of the Buddhist monuments in the
        state.[24] It was ruled by Mauryan Empire, Satavahana dynasty,
        Salankayanas, Andhra Ikshvakus, Pallavas, Vishnukundinas, Eastern
        Chalukyas, Rashtrakutas, Cholas, Kakatiyas, Vijayanagara Empire,
        Gajapati Empire, Mughal Empire, Deccan sultanates, Qutb Shahi dynasty,
        and Asaf Jahis. In the 3rd century BCE, Andhra was a vassal kingdom of
        Ashoka but after his death Andhra became powerful and extended its
        empire to the whole of Maratha country and beyond.
