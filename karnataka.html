          Karnataka is a state in southwest India with Arabian Sea coastlines.
          The capital, Bengaluru (formerly Bangalore), is a high-tech hub known
          for its shopping and nightlife. To the southwest, Mysore is home to
          lavish temples including Mysore Palace, former seat of the region’s
          maharajas. Hampi, once the medieval Vijayanagara empire’s capital,
          contains ruins of Hindu temples, elephant stables and a stone chariot.

        The coastal region of Karavali and Tulu Nadu The hilly Malenadu region
        comprising the Western Ghats The Bayaluseeme region comprising the
        plains of the Deccan Plateau The bulk of the state is in the Bayaluseeme
        region, the northern part of which is the second-largest arid region in
        India.[58] The highest point in Karnataka is the Mullayanagiri hills in
        Chikmagalur district which has an altitude of 1,925 metres (6,316 ft).
        The two main river systems of the state are the Krishna and its
        tributaries, the Bhima, Ghataprabha, Vedavathi, Malaprabha and
        Tungabhadra in North Karnataka, and the Kaveri and its tributaries, the
        Hemavati, Shimsha, Arkavati, Lakshmana Thirtha and Kabini, in South
        Karnataka. Most of these rivers flow out of Karnataka eastward, reaching
        the sea at the Bay of Bengal. Other prominent rivers such as the
        Sharavati in Shimoga and Netravati in Dakshina Kannada flow westward,
        reaching the sea at the Arabian Sea. A large number of dams and
        reservoirs are constructed across these rivers which richly add to the
        irrigation and hydroelectricity power generation capacities of the
        state. Karnataka consists of four main types of geological
        formations[59] – the Archean complex made up of Dharwad schists and
        granitic gneisses,[60] the Proterozoic non-fossiliferous sedimentary
        formations of the Kaladgi and Bhima series[61], the Deccan trappean and
        intertrappean deposits and the tertiary and recent laterites and
        alluvial deposits.[62] Laterite cappings that are found in many
        districts over the Deccan Traps were formed after the cessation of
        volcanic activity in the early tertiary period. Eleven groups of soil
        orders are found in Karnataka, viz. Entisols, Inceptisols, Mollisols,
        Spodosols, Alfisols, Ultisols, Oxisols, Aridisols, Vertisols, Andisols
        and Histosols.[59][63] Depending on the agricultural capability of the
        soil, the soil types are divided into six types, viz. red, lateritic,
        black, alluvio-colluvial, forest and coastal soils.[63]
